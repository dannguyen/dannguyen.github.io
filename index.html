    <h1>Dan Nguyen is on Github!</h1>

    <p>Check out my "code respository" at <a href="https://github.com/dannguyen">https://github.com/dannguyen</a>. It is a place where I store code and where we can be social about code. I like Ruby and I hope someday to learn a lisp. How about you?</p>

    <p>I also have a "blog", which is short for <strong>World Wide Web Log</strong>: <a href="http://blog.danwin.com">http://blog.danwin.com</a>
    </p>

    <p>
        I currently work at Stanford Univeresity, which is an <strong>Institution of Higher Learning</strong> located in <strong>Stanford, California!</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>Stanford's mascot is known as the Tree, named after President Herbert Hoover's fourth child.</p>


<h3>COOL Fact!</h3>
<p>You can see the "source code" of my World Wide Website at the following hyper-link: <a href="https://github.com/dannguyen/dannguyen.github.io">https://github.com/dannguyen/dannguyen.github.io</a>

Please give me a "Star" because you never know if I'm having a bad day and I will need that star! Thx.
